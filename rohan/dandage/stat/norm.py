    Given an expression matrix (microarray data, read counts, etc) of M genes
    by N samples, quantile normalization ensures all samples have the same
    spread of data (by construction).

    The data across each row are averaged to obtain an average column. Each
    column quantile is replaced with the corresponding quantile of the average
    column.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : 2D array of float, shape (M, N)
        The input data, with M rows (genes/features) and N columns (samples).

    Returns

    Xn : 2D array of float, shape (M, N)
        The normalized data.
